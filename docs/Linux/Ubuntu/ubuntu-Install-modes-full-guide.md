## Special Notes

### 1. Linux manages all application updates centrally

Setting up Ubuntu alongside Windows 11 or 10 is the best way to get the power of Linux without losing your Windows environment. This setup is called "dual-booting." Here is your updated, step-by-step guide tailored for both versions of Windows!

## Your Guide to Dual-Booting Ubuntu with Windows 11/10

This guide covers everything from prepping your hard drive to choosing your OS when you flip the power switch.

---

### What You'll Need (Requirements):

1. **A Computer with Windows 11 or 10 Installed:** Ensure your system is up to date.
2. **Ubuntu ISO Image:** Go to [ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* **LTS (Long Term Support):** **Highly Recommended.** It’s the most stable and receives security updates for years.


3. **USB Stick (8GB or larger):** This will be your "installer." **Warning:** Everything on this USB will be erased.
4. **Rufus Software (Free):** To turn the ISO file into a bootable USB.
5. **Important:** **Backup Your Important Files!** While this process is standard, moving partitions always carries a small risk. Save your documents to an external drive or cloud storage first.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Windows 11/10

We need to make room for Ubuntu by shrinking the space Windows currently uses.

#### 1.1 Create Free Space (Shrink Partition)

1. **Open Disk Management:** Right-click the **Start button** and select **Disk Management**.
2. **Identify Your Main Drive:** Look for your **(C:)** drive.
3. **Shrink the Volume:** * Right-click the **(C:)** partition and select **Shrink Volume...**
* **How much space?** Enter the amount in MB. 1024MB = 1GB.
* **Recommendation:** Use at least **50,000 MB (50GB)** for a comfortable experience.
* Click **Shrink**.


4. **The Result:** You will now see a block of black space labeled **"Unallocated."** Leave it exactly like that.

#### 1.2 Disable Fast Startup

Windows "locks" the hard drive during a fast shutdown, which can prevent Ubuntu from installing correctly.

1. Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Control Panel**, and open it.
2. Go to **Hardware and Sound > Power Options**.
3. Click **Choose what the power buttons do**.
4. Click **Change settings that are currently unavailable** at the top.
5. Uncheck **Turn on fast startup (recommended)** and click **Save changes**.

---

### Step 2: Create the Bootable USB

1. Download **Rufus** from [rufus.ie](https://rufus.ie).
2. Plug in your USB stick and open Rufus.
3. **Device:** Select your USB stick.
4. **Boot selection:** Click **SELECT** and choose the Ubuntu `.iso` file you downloaded.
5. **Partition scheme:** * For almost all Windows 11 and modern Windows 10 PCs, select **GPT**.
* **Target system** should stay as **UEFI (non CSM)**.


6. Click **START**. If asked to write in "ISO Image mode," click **OK**.

---

### Step 3: Boot from USB

1. Keep the USB plugged in and **Restart** your PC.
2. As soon as the screen lights up, tap your **Boot Menu Key** repeatedly.
* *Common keys:* **F12** (Dell/Lenovo), **F9** (HP), **F8** (Asus), or **F11/F12** (Acer).


3. Select your USB stick (often labeled **UEFI: [USB Brand Name]**) and press **Enter**.

---

### Step 4: The Ubuntu Installation

1. **Try or Install:** Select **"Try or Install Ubuntu"** from the menu.
2. **Welcome:** Select your language and click **Install Ubuntu**.
3. **Updates:** Select **"Normal installation"** and check the box for **"Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi."** This is vital for drivers!
4. **Installation Type:** This is the most important part.
* Look for the option: **"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager."**
* **Select this.** It will automatically detect the "Unallocated Space" you made in Step 1.


5. **User Setup:** Enter your name, a name for your PC, and a **strong password**. You will need this password every time you install software in Ubuntu!

---

### Step 5: Finishing Up

1. The installation will run. Once it's done, click **Restart Now**.
2. **Remove the USB:** When you see a message on a black screen, pull out the USB drive and press **Enter**.
3. **The GRUB Menu:** Now, every time you start your computer, a menu will appear:
* **Ubuntu:** Boots your new Linux system.
* **Windows Boot Manager:** Boots your Windows 11/10 system.

### Step 6: At Start, if you given Linux and Windows choice to enter


#### Option 1: The Windows Fix (No USB needed)

Windows has the power to tell the motherboard which "door" to open first.

1. Open the **Start Menu**, type `cmd`, right-click **Command Prompt**, and select **Run as Administrator**.
2. Type this exact command and press Enter:
`bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi`
3. **Restart your computer.** 4.  If it worked, the purple Ubuntu/Zorin menu will appear. Now you can select Ubuntu, log in, and perform **Step 1** (the `sudo` commands) from my previous message to make the fix permanent.

---

#### Option 2: The USB Fix (If Option 1 fails)

If Windows refuses to change the boot path, you have to "chroot" (teleport) into your installed Linux using the USB stick.

1. **Boot from your Ubuntu/Zorin USB** (Select "Try Ubuntu").
2. Open the **Terminal** and find your Linux partition:
`sudo fdisk -l`
*(Look for the 200GB partition labeled "Linux filesystem", e.g., `/dev/nvme0n1p4`)*.
3. **Mount your Linux system** so the USB can see it:
`sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p4 /mnt` *(Replace with your actual partition name)*
4. **Mount the EFI partition** (the tiny ~100-500MB one):
`sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi`
5. **Teleport into your installed system:**
```bash
for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done
sudo chroot /mnt

```


6. **Now you are "inside" your installed Linux!** You can now run the repair commands:
```bash
nano /etc/default/grub  # (Make the changes I mentioned before)
update-grub
exit

```


7. **Reboot** and unplug the USB.

#### Summary for your future "Clean Install"

When you do your final clean install:

1. Install **Windows 11** first.
2. Install **Ubuntu** second.
3. **Immediately after Ubuntu finishes**, if it boots straight to Windows, use **Option 1** above. It is the fastest way to "knock" on the motherboard's door and tell it to let Ubuntu handle the boot menu.

### Mount windows drive's to share data and AI models (avoid duplicate instance and save disk space)

To mount your **530 GB NTFS Common Data** drive so it appears automatically in Ubuntu with full read/write permissions, follow these steps.

#### 1. Identify the Drive's "ID" (UUID)

Every partition has a unique ID called a UUID. We need this so Ubuntu knows exactly which drive to mount.

1. Open the **Terminal** in Ubuntu (`Ctrl + Alt + T`).
2. Type this command:
`lsblk -f`
3. Look for the partition that is roughly **530G** and has the **FSTYPE** `ntfs`.
4. Copy the long code under the **UUID** column (it looks like `519CB82E5888AD0F`).

---

#### 2. Create a "Mount Point"

A mount point is just a folder where the data will appear.

1. In the terminal, create a folder named `Common_Data`:
`sudo mkdir -p /media/Common_Data`

---

#### 3. Configure the Auto-Mount (Edit fstab)

Now we tell Ubuntu to "plug in" that drive to that folder every time you turn on the PC.

1. Open the configuration file:
`sudo nano /etc/fstab`
2. Use the arrow keys to go to the very bottom of the file and add this **exact** line (replace `YOUR-UUID-HERE` with the code you copied in Step 1):
`UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE  /media/Common_Data  ntfs-3g  defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000,nofail  0  0`
> **What this does:** > * `uid=1000,gid=1000`: Makes **you** the owner of the files.
> * `umask=000`: Gives you full Read/Write/Execute permissions.
> * `nofail`: If the drive is missing for some reason, the PC will still boot instead of getting stuck.
> 
> 


3. Press `Ctrl + O` then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

---

#### 4. Test it Immediately

Before you restart, tell Ubuntu to try mounting everything in the file we just edited:
`sudo mount -a`

Now, open your **File Manager**. You should see **Common_Data** in the left sidebar. If you can create a folder inside it, you have successfully set it up!

---

#### ⚠️ One Critical Troubleshooting Step

If you get an error saying **"The disk contains an unclean file system"** or **"Operation not permitted"**:
It means Windows is still "holding" the drive.

1. Reboot into **Windows**.
2. Go to **Control Panel > Power Options > Choose what the power buttons do**.
3. Uncheck **"Turn on fast startup"**.
4. **Shut down** completely (do not just Restart), then boot back into Ubuntu.

**Would you like me to show you how to bookmark this drive in your Ubuntu sidebar so it’s always one click away?**

**Success!** You’ve officially entered the world of dual-booting.
