# Zero-shot prompting 

It's is a technique used with large language models (LLMs) where you instruct the model to perform a task **without providing any prior examples** of that task being done.

Essentially, you rely solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge and general understanding to complete the request, leveraging the vast information it absorbed during training. It's the simplest form of prompting and the foundation for more advanced techniques like few-shot prompting.

## 💡 Key Concept: The Power of Generalization

Think of a zero-shot prompt like asking a well-read and intelligent person a question they've never seen before. Because of their extensive background knowledge (the LLM's training data), they can typically answer it correctly or perform the requested task based on related concepts they've already learned.

**Zero-Shot Prompting Formula:**

$$\text{Instruction (Task Description) + Input Data = Desired Output}$$

## 🌍 Real-Life Zero-Shot Examples (Beyond Code)

Zero-shot prompting works everywhere the LLM has deep domain knowledge.

### 1. Legal Context (Translating Jargon)

| Component | Prompt Section |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actor** | Act as a law professor specializing in contract law. |
| **Mission** | Translate the following clause into plain, 5th-grade-level English. |
| **Input** | *[Paste a dense, jargon-filled legal clause about indemnification.]* |
| **Constraint** | The output must be less than 50 words and be presented as a single paragraph. |

### 2. Marketing/Business Context (Competitive Analysis)

| Component | Prompt Section |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actor** | Act as a savvy Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). |
| **Mission** | Analyze the following three marketing slogans and predict which will generate the highest CTR (Click-Through Rate). |
| **Input** | *[Provide three slogans: Slogan A, Slogan B, Slogan C.]* |
| **Constraint** | Provide your final answer as a single choice and then provide three bullet points defending your selection based on emotional hooks and clarity. |

### 3. Personal/Creative Context (Meal Planning)

| Component | Prompt Section |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actor** | Act as a nutritionist and personal chef. |
| **Mission** | Create a 3-day meal plan (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. |
| **Input** | My dietary restrictions are: no shellfish, no red meat. |
| **Constraint** | List the ingredients and approximate cooking time for each meal in a comprehensive table. |

## 🛠️ Zero-Shot Prompting in a Software Context

Zero-shot prompting is incredibly useful in software development for quick, initial tasks where you don't have existing examples to feed the model.

### 1. Zero-Shot Coding

The model generates code based only on the functional requirements given in the prompt.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Write a complete, functional code snippet. |
| **Instruction** | Clearly define the function, language, and inputs/outputs. |
| **Prompt** | **"Write a Python function named `calculate_factorial` that accepts an integer and returns its factorial. Handle the case where the input is a negative number by returning a ValueError."** |
| **Model Output** | (The model outputs the complete, working Python code.)  |

### 2. Zero-Shot Code Review

The model critiques a code snippet based on general programming best practices, security, and efficiency.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Identify flaws or suggest improvements in existing code. |
| **Instruction** | Define the criteria for the review (e.g., security, readability, efficiency). |
| **Prompt** | **"Act as a Senior Principal Engineer. Review the following JavaScript code for readability, performance, and adherence to modern ES6 standards. Provide specific suggestions for improvement."** *[Paste JavaScript code here]* |
| **Model Output** | (The model analyzes the code and suggests replacing `var` with `let/const`, using template literals, etc.) |

### 3. Zero-Shot Requirements Analysis

The model converts a high-level goal into structured, technical requirements.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Convert a vague business request into clear, actionable requirements. |
| **Instruction** | Specify the format (e.g., User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, API endpoints). |
| **Prompt** | **"Based on the following business goal, generate three detailed user stories with acceptance criteria, following the 'As a [User Role], I want [Goal], so that [Reason]' format."** *[Business Goal: "Allow users to securely reset their forgotten passwords."]* |
| **Model Output** | (The model produces structured user stories like: "As a registered user, I want to receive a secure, one-time-use link via email to reset my password, so that I can regain access to my account.") |

## 📝 Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Comprehensive Zero-Shot Prompts

A great zero-shot prompt is not just a question; it's a **self-contained instruction set**. Follow these steps for maximum effectiveness:

### Step 1: Define the **Actor** (Persona/Expertise)
Start by telling the AI **who to be**. This steers the tone and knowledge base.

* *Example:* "Act as a **Penetration Tester**." or "Act as a **Technical Writer for a Fortune 500 company**."

### Step 2: Define the **Mission** (Action)
State the main task clearly, using strong **action verbs**.

* *Example:* "**Summarize,**" "**Critique,**" "**Generate,**" or "**Translate**."

### Step 3: Define the **Input** (Context/Data)
Provide all the necessary information, either by pasting it or by linking to it conceptually.

* *Example:* "Using **the following ten lines of C# code...**" or "Based on **the concept of atomic commits...**"

### Step 4: Define the **Constraint/Format** (Output Specification)
This is the most critical step for quality control. Tell the model **how** to structure its output.

* *Example:* "The response must be in the form of a **JSON object** with keys for 'title' and 'summary'." or "Limit your answer to **150 words** and use **bullet points**."

### ➡️ Putting it Together (Comprehensive Zero-Shot Prompt)

> "Act as a **highly efficient database architect** (**Actor**). **Critique** the attached SQL query for performance and potential security vulnerabilities (**Mission**). The critique must be formatted as a **three-column Markdown table** with headers 'Issue Category', 'Description', and 'Suggested Fix' (**Constraint/Format**). Use only best practices related to **PostgreSQL** (**Constraint**). **Here is the query:** *[Paste complex SQL query]* (**Input**)."
