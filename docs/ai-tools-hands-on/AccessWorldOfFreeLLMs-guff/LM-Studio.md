# LLMs for common laptop H/W config



## Continue config for LM Studio
```yaml

name: Local Config
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1
models:
  - name: "LM Studio"
    provider: "lmstudio"
    apiBase: "http://localhost:1234/v1"
    model: "local-model"
```

## 💻 1. Recommended Models for i5/16GB RAM (GGUF)

These models offer the best combination of intelligence and efficiency, running comfortably on your system using the **Q4\_K\_M** or **Q5\_K\_M** quantization formats (which LM Studio supports):

| Model Family | Size (Parameters) | LM Studio Search Term | Ideal Quantization | Est. File Size (GB) | Est. Max RAM Usage (GB) | Primary Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Qwen Coder** | **7 Billion (7B)** | **`Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF`** | **Q4\_K\_M** | ~4.7 GB | ~7-8 GB | **Best for Code Generation, Debugging, and Reasoning.** |
| **Llama 3.1** | **8 Billion (8B)** | **`Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF`** | **Q5\_K\_M** | ~5.7 GB | ~9-10 GB | **Best General-Purpose Model** (Writing, Chat, Complex Instructions). |
| **Mistral** | **7 Billion (7B)** | **`Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF`** | **Q4\_K\_M** | ~4.4 GB | ~7 GB | Fast, reliable, and excellent all-around performance. |
| **Gemma 3** | **4 Billion (4B)** | **`Gemma 3 4B Instruct GGUF`** | **Q4\_K\_M** | ~2.5 GB | ~5-6 GB | **Fastest Response Speed**, highly efficient for quick summarization. |

> **Note:** The "Estimated Max RAM Usage" accounts for the model file size plus the system overhead (LM Studio, OS, and the model's working memory, or KV Cache). All are well within your 16GB limit.

## 🖥️ 2. Hardware Profile and Performance Targets

Your Dell Latitude 7490 with an 8th-gen i5 and 16GB of RAM is optimized for **CPU Inference**.

| Component | Your Specs | Inference Role & Constraint | Optimization Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | i5 (8th Gen, **8 Logical Processors**) | **Primary Inference Engine** (Handles all computation). | **Maximize CPU Threads** to ensure parallel processing speed. |
| **RAM** | **16 GB** | **Model Storage** (The model file sits here during use). | **Use Q4\_K\_M/Q5\_K\_M** to fit models comfortably and leave system headroom. |
| **GPU/VRAM** | Integrated Graphics (Intel UHD 620) | **Not Used.** Integrated GPU offers negligible benefit for LLM inference. | **Set GPU Offload to 0** to avoid potential bottlenecks. |

## ⚙️ 3. Step-by-Step LM Studio Optimization for Your Setup

After downloading your chosen GGUF file (e.g., `Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`), apply these settings in the **Chat Tab** on the **right-hand sidebar** to ensure the best performance on your i5 CPU:

### Step 1: Maximize CPU Cores (Crucial for Speed)

* **Setting:** **"Threads"** (under "Hardware Settings").
* **Action:** Set this value to **8** (or slightly less, like 6 or 7, to keep your system highly responsive).
* *Why:* This utilizes all logical cores of your i5 CPU, which is your main processing power.

### Step 2: Disable GPU Offloading (Avoid Bottleneck)

* **Setting:** **"GPU Offload"** (Often labeled "N-Gpu Layers").
* **Action:** Set the value to **0** (Zero).
* *Why:* You do not have a dedicated GPU, so forcing the model onto the integrated graphics will slow you down. CPU-only is the fastest path here.

### Step 3: Quantize the Working Memory (Save RAM)

* **Setting:** **"KV-Cache Quantization Type"** (Under the Advanced tab).
* **Action:** Change the default (`F16` or `FP16`) to **`Q4_K_M`** or **`Q5_K_M`**.
* *Why:* This compresses the model's short-term memory (the cache), freeing up significant RAM and preventing slow-down during longer conversations.

### Step 4: Set Optimal Context Length (Balance Memory/Quality)

* **Setting:** **"Context Length"** (or "Context Size").
* **Action:** Start with **4096** or **8192**.
* *Why:* This is a safe and high-quality context size. While models like Llama 3.1 support up to 128K, using a context that large consumes too much of your limited 16GB RAM and will drastically slow down generation.

With these models and these four optimization steps, you will be running state-of-the-art LLMs locally, achieving very respectable token-per-second generation speeds on your laptop.
