# **Docker Model Runner (DMR)** 

## For Docker Engine installed on Linux:

### 1\. Install the Docker Model Plugin

    The `docker-model-plugin` is available in Docker's official APT repository for Linux.

    1.  **Update your package list:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
    2.  **Install the plugin:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install docker-model-plugin -y
        ```
    3.  **Verify the installation:**
        ```bash
        docker model version
        ```
        If successful, this command will display the version information for the Docker Model Runner, and the `docker model` command is now available for use.

### 2\. Run Your Model

    With the plugin installed, you can now use your original command to pull and run the Llama 2 model. The `docker model run` command handles the pull and start process automatically.

    ```bash
    docker model run ai/llama2:7b-chat
    ```

#### What this command does:

  * **Pulls the Model:** It downloads the `llama2:7b-chat` model artifact from the `ai/` namespace on Docker Hub.
  * **Starts the Inference Server:** It launches a model engine (typically backed by `llama.cpp`) to serve the model.
  * **Launches Interactive Chat:** It opens an interactive chat session in your terminal where you can start interacting with the model. (Type `/bye` to exit the chat).

Alternatively, if you only want to pull the model and check the status:

  * **To pull only:** `docker model pull ai/llama2:7b-chat`
  * **To list models:** `docker model list`


## 🚀 The Docker Coexistence Guide with Model Runner

You might have **standalone Docker Engine (Host Engine)** already installed, **Docker Desktop**, and the **Docker Model Runner (DMR)** can also run in parallel.

The core concept is to use **Docker Contexts** to switch the target of your `docker` CLI, and **Systemd** commands to manage the Host Engine service.

### I. Setup: Install and Enable Components

1.  **Install Docker Desktop:** Follow the official instructions to install Docker Desktop.
2.  **Enable Model Runner (DMR):**
      * Launch **Docker Desktop**.
      * Go to **Settings** $\rightarrow$ **AI** (or **Features in development**).
      * Check **Enable Docker Model Runner**.
      * Click **Apply & Restart**.

### II. Managing the Host Docker Engine Service (The Golden Rule)

When you install Docker Engine on Ubuntu, it typically sets itself up as a **systemd service** that starts automatically at boot (`docker.service`, `docker.socket`, and `containerd.service`).

To prevent conflicts with Docker Desktop's engine, you should manage this service.

| Goal | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stop Temporarily** (For the current session) | `sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket containerd` | Shuts down the Host Engine immediately. This is the command you run daily before using Docker Desktop. |
| **Disable Permanently** (Prevent autostart on boot) | `sudo systemctl disable docker.service docker.socket containerd.service` | Prevents the Host Engine from starting automatically when you reboot your machine. |
| **Enable Permanently** (Restore autostart) | `sudo systemctl enable docker.service docker.socket containerd.service` | Re-enables the Host Engine to start automatically when you reboot. |
| **Start/Restart** (To use the Host Engine) | `sudo systemctl start docker` | Starts the Host Engine service (if it was disabled or stopped). |

### III. Switching Between Engine Environments with Docker Contexts

The `docker` CLI uses a **context** to determine which Docker Engine daemon it should communicate with.

#### 1\. To Work in **Docker Desktop** (and use Model Runner)

This environment is ideal for using the GUI, Kubernetes, and the integrated Model Runner features.

1.  **Stop the Host Engine (Crucial):** If it's running, shut down the standalone service.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket containerd
    ```

2. Start Docker Desktop via the GUI (Recommended for first launch)

    The first time you launch it, the GUI is usually required to **accept the Docker Subscription Service Agreement**. Without accepting this, the backend engine often will not start.

    -  Open your **Applications** menu (or press the Super/Windows key).
    -  Search for **"Docker Desktop"** and click the icon to launch the application.
    -  The application will guide you through the initial setup, including accepting the terms.

3. Start Docker Desktop via the Command Line

    Once installed, the Docker Desktop application registers a user-specific systemd service that you can start from the terminal.

    Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user start docker-desktop
    ```

    This command runs the Docker Desktop application in the background.

    After you have started Docker Desktop:

4.  **Wait a few moments** for the application to initialize its engine and set up the necessary files (it can take up to a minute).

5.  **Verify the context now exists:**

    ```bash
    docker context ls
    ```

    You should see `desktop-linux` listed, possibly with an asterisk (`*`) next to it if the application set it as the current context automatically.

6.  **Switch to the Docker Desktop context (if needed):**

    ```bash
    docker context use desktop-linux
    ```

    This command should now succeed, as the required files will have been created by the running Docker Desktop application.



7.  **Switch the CLI to Docker Desktop:** The `desktop-linux` context points to the VM-based engine.
    ```bash
    docker context use desktop-linux
    ```
8.  **Verify:** Check the currently active context.
    ```bash
    docker context ls
    ```
    *(The `desktop-linux` entry should have the `*`.)*

#### 2\. To Work in the **Standalone Host Engine**

This environment is useful if you need to run containers directly on your host or troubleshoot the base installation.

1.  **Stop Docker Desktop:** Quit the application from the tray icon or command line.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user stop docker-desktop
    ```
2.  **Ensure Host Engine is Running:** Start the service if it was stopped or disabled.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```
3.  **Switch the CLI to the Host Engine:** The `default` context points to the host's daemon.
    ```bash
    docker context use default
    ```
4.  **Verify:** Check the currently active context.
    ```bash
    docker context ls
    ```
    *(The `default` entry should have the `*`.)*

### IV. Running Models with Docker Model Runner (DMR)

The Model Runner service is tightly integrated with the Docker Desktop environment.

1.  **Ensure you are in the `desktop-linux` context.**
2.  **Pull a Model:**
    ```bash
    docker model pull ai/llama2:7b-chat
    ```
3.  **Run a Model (Interactive Chat):**
    ```bash
    docker model run ai/llama2:7b-chat
    ```
4.  **Check Status:** The Model Runner service itself runs outside the main Docker Desktop VM but is managed by it.
    ```bash
    docker model status
    ```

# #########################################################################

Yes, you can run and manage all three: your **standalone Docker Engine**, **Docker Desktop**, and **Docker Model Runner** on Ubuntu.

**Docker Model Runner (DMR)** is a feature of Docker Desktop (and also available as a plugin for Docker Engine CE) that allows you to run local AI models (like LLMs) using familiar `docker model` CLI commands.

Here is the regenerated guide, including the Model Runner steps and how it interacts with the two Docker environments.

-----

## 🚀 The Docker Coexistence Guide with Model Runner

The core concept for managing these environments is **Context Switching** using the `docker context` command.

### I. Setup: Enable Model Runner

Docker Model Runner (DMR) is typically enabled through the Docker Desktop application settings.

1.  **Install Docker Desktop:** Complete the installation as you have done.
2.  **Enable DMR:**
      * Launch **Docker Desktop** (from the Applications Menu).
      * Go to **Settings** (gear icon) $\rightarrow$ **AI** (or **Features in development** in older versions).
      * Ensure **Enable Docker Model Runner** is checked.
      * **Recommended:** Select **Enable host-side TCP support** (default port 12434) if you plan to access the model API from applications *outside* of a container (e.g., a local web app).
      * Click **Apply & Restart**.

Once enabled, the `docker model` CLI command becomes available for both the Docker Desktop and the standalone Engine (though the Model Runner service itself runs outside the Docker Desktop VM).

### II. The Golden Rule: Stop the Host Engine

To prevent conflicts (especially on ports) and resource contention, you should **stop** your standalone Docker Engine service when you are using Docker Desktop and its related tools like Model Runner.

| Scenario | Action | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Using Docker Desktop/Model Runner** | **Stop** the Host Engine | `sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket containerd` |
| **Using Standalone Host Engine** | **Stop** Docker Desktop | `systemctl --user stop docker-desktop` |

### III. Switching Between Engine Environments

The `docker context` command is your control panel for directing the `docker` CLI.

#### 1\. To Use **Docker Desktop** (and Model Runner)

This is the context you use for GUI management, Kubernetes, and local AI model running.

```bash
# 1. Ensure the Host Engine is stopped
sudo systemctl stop docker

# 2. Start Docker Desktop and switch the CLI context
docker context use desktop-linux
```

  * **Result:** The `docker` commands now target the Docker Engine inside the Docker Desktop VM. The `docker model` commands will use the Model Runner service managed by Docker Desktop.

#### 2\. To Use the **Standalone Host Engine**

This is the context you use for traditional container workloads running directly on your Ubuntu host.

```bash
# 1. Stop Docker Desktop (quitting the application is sufficient)
systemctl --user stop docker-desktop

# 2. Switch the CLI to the Host Engine
docker context use default

# 3. Ensure the Host Engine is running
sudo systemctl start docker
```

  * **Result:** The `docker` commands now target your system's `/var/run/docker.sock`. Note that if you use Model Runner via Docker Engine CE instead of Desktop, the `default` context is where you would access it, but managing both is less common.

### IV. Running Models with Docker Model Runner (DMR)

DMR uses the **`docker model`** CLI command and typically runs the inference server natively on the host machine for optimal performance.

1.  **Verify DMR is Active:** Ensure you are using the `desktop-linux` context and Docker Desktop is running.

    ```bash
    docker model status
    # Output should confirm: Docker Model Runner is running.
    ```

2.  **Pull a Model:** Models are pulled from Docker Hub (or other OCI registries) using the `docker model pull` command.

    ```bash
    docker model pull ai/smollm2:latest
    ```

3.  **Run a Model (Interactive Chat):** This will start an interactive chat session in your terminal, similar to using a local LLM application.

    ```bash
    docker model run ai/smollm2:latest
    ```

4.  **Run a Model (One-Shot Prompt):** You can also send a single prompt from the command line.

    ```bash
    docker model run ai/smollm2:latest "Explain the difference between a container and an image."
    ```

5.  **Access Model API from a Container:** Your application running in a container can access the model using the internal DNS name: `http://model-runner.docker.internal/`.

      * For example, a `docker run` command for an app would target an API endpoint like: `http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1/chat/completions`.

This setup allows you to keep your traditional Docker development flow separate from your new GenAI/LLM local model experimentation, all managed through the same `docker` command line tool.

## Reverting back to Docker Engine:


This part assumes you have the **native Docker Engine** already installed and running (e.g., the `docker.io` package). The goal is to remove Docker Desktop and point your CLI back to the native engine.

### Step 1: Uninstall Docker Desktop

Use your package manager to remove the Docker Desktop package. This step removes the application files but often leaves configuration and data behind.

```bash
# 1. Stop the Docker Desktop service
systemctl --user stop docker-desktop

# 2. Uninstall the package
sudo apt purge docker-desktop
```

### Step 2: Restore the Docker Context

After the uninstall, your Docker CLI may still be configured to look for the **`desktop-linux`** context, which is now gone. You must explicitly switch it back to the local Engine's **`default`** context.

#### A. Switch Context

If the `docker` command is still available (which is the goal), run:

```bash
docker context use default
```

#### B. Handle Broken CLI (The Fix for the `No such file or directory` Error)

If you encounter the error `bash: /usr/local/bin/docker: No such file or directory`, it means the link for the `docker` command was broken.

1.  **Use the full path to the executable to reset the context:**

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/docker context use default
    ```

    *(We use `/usr/bin/docker` because that is the common location for the native Docker Engine CLI on Ubuntu.)*

2.  **Fix the broken command link (Optional, but highly recommended):**

    ```bash
    # Remove the broken symlink from the higher-priority directory
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker

    # Re-verify the simple command works
    docker version
    ```

### Step 3: Clean Up Leftover Configuration Files

Docker Desktop leaves metadata and configuration files in your user directory. Cleaning these up ensures a completely fresh start for your native Docker Engine.

1.  **Remove the non-existent Docker Desktop context:**

    ```bash
    docker context rm desktop-linux
    ```

    *(If the context file is already gone, this command will simply report that it was not found, which is fine.)*

2.  **Remove Docker Desktop's configuration directory:**

    ```bash
    rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop
    ```

3.  **Edit the main Docker configuration file:**
    The file `$HOME/.docker/config.json` might still contain references to `credsStore` or the old `currentContext`.

    *Open the file with a text editor:*

    ```bash
    nano $HOME/.docker/config.json
    ```

    *Ensure the file looks clean, or at least has the context pointing to default:*

    ```json
    {
      // Optional: Remove "credsStore" if it was set to "desktop"
      // "credsStore": "desktop", 
      
      // Ensure the current context is "default"
      "currentContext": "default" 
      
      // Other settings (like "auths") can remain
    }
    ```

    Save and close the file.

### Step 4: Verification

Confirm the switch was successful by checking the active context and running a test container.

```bash
# Verify the context is set to default
docker context ls
```

*Expected result: An asterisk (`*`) next to `default`, pointing to `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.*

```bash
# Run the test container against the native Engine
docker run hello-world
```

*Expected result: A successful message about the image running locally.*
