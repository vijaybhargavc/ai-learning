# AI-PC-Tiers-For-Ununtu.26.0

### Tier 1: The "Bandwidth King" (Your Optimized Setup)

**Total Investment:** **$4,080 CAD** **Hardware:** Minisforum UM890 Pro + OCuLink Dock/Cable + RTX 3090 (24GB)

* **The Powerhouse:** The RTX 3090 is the star here. With **936 GB/s** of memory bandwidth, it processes tokens at nearly 3.5x the speed of integrated solutions.
* **AI Inference:** Perfect for models up to 20B–30B parameters (e.g., Llama-3 8B or Mistral 24B). You will see instant, fluid text generation.
* **AI Tuning/Training:** This is the best value for fine-tuning. Training a LoRA on a 7B model will be fast enough to iterate several times an hour.
* **The Limit:** You are hard-capped at 24GB VRAM. If a model needs 30GB, your speed drops to a crawl as it spills over into system RAM.

### Tier 2: The "Memory Giant" (Integrated Only)

**Total Investment:** **$4,500 CAD** **Hardware:** Minisforum MS-S1 Max (128GB Unified RAM)

* **The Scale:** You trade raw speed for a **massive 128GB VRAM-like bucket**.
* **AI Inference:** You can run **Llama-3 70B** or **DeepSeek-V3** entirely in memory. It won't be "instant," but it will be usable (approx. 5–12 tokens per second).
* **AI Tuning:** Allows you to fine-tune massive models that would crash a single 3090.
* **Verdict:** On its own, this is a "Researcher's Rig." It’s for people who care more about the *intelligence* of the model than the *speed* of the chat.

### Tier 3: The "Hybrid Beast" (The Ultimate Combo)

**Total Investment:** **$7,070 CAD** **Hardware:** MS-S1 Max (128GB) + RTX 3090 (24GB) via PCIe-OCuLink ($90)

* **The Experience:** This setup is effectively a **152GB VRAM Workstation**.
* **How it Works (Ubuntu 26.04):** You use the 3090's high speed for the "Prefill/Prompt Processing" (making the AI understand your long text instantly) and the 128GB system RAM to hold the massive weights of a 100B+ parameter model.
* **Training:** You can keep your training data in the 128GB pool and feed it into the 3090 for the actual math, making this a professional-grade development station.

### Comparison of Real-World Capabilities

| Metric | Tier 1 ($4k) | Tier 2 ($4.5k) | Tier 3 ($7k) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Max Model Size** | 30B (Compressed) | 128B+ | **Unlimited (400B+)** |
| **8B Model Speed** | **65+ tok/s** | 22 tok/s | 65+ tok/s |
| **70B Model Speed** | N/A (Crashes) | 5-8 tok/s | **12-15 tok/s** |
| **VRAM Bandwidth** | **936 GB/s** | 256 GB/s | **Hybrid (High)** |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Simple | Advanced (Dual GPU) |

### The "Pro" Recommendation

If you have already spent the **$2,480** on the 3090 and the Dock, jumping to the MS-S1 Max ($4,500) represents a nearly **$7,000 total investment**.

* **Stick with Tier 1 (UM890 Pro) if:** You are primarily coding or using the AI for creative writing where you want the answer *now*.
* **Go for Tier 3 (MS-S1 + 3090) if:** You are a developer or researcher who needs to run the "SOTA" (State of the Art) models like Llama-3.1 405B or DeepSeek-V3 locally for privacy or testing.

**Since you are looking at a $7,000 total budget for the Hybrid setup, would you like me to compare that against a custom-built desktop PC which could hold TWO RTX 3090s for the same price?**
