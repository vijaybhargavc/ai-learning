## 🔧 Critical Configuration Steps

Achieving stable and fast performance requires specific adjustments outside of the default settings:

### 1. BIOS Configuration

* **VRAM Allocation:** Repeatedly press **Esc** upon reboot to enter the BIOS and set the dedicated graphics memory to **96GB**.
* **Performance Mode:** Activate the system's **Performance mode**.

### 2. Windows Performance Tuning (CMD Admin)

The "High performance" power plan must be manually unhidden and configured for maximum stability:

1.  Open **Terminal (Admin)** (Right-click Windows Menu).
2.  Enter the command: `powercfg -setactive SCHEME_MIN`
3.  In **Control Panel / Power Options** (High performance plan):
    * Set **Minimum processor state** to **100%**.
    * Set **Turn off hard disk after** to **Never**.
    * Set **Sleep after** to **Never**.

### 3. Software Optimization & Clean-Up

* **Disable Background Apps:** Disable Edge's "Startup boost" and "Continue running background extensions."
* **System Services:** Use `msconfig` to disable unnecessary services like the Print Spooler.
* **Windows Features:** Delete memory-consuming features like **OneDrive** and the **Recall** feature.
* **Driver Warning:** **Before upgrading** the **AMD Adrenalin** driver software (e.g., to 25.8.1), set a **System Restore Point**, as new driver versions may degrade ROCm inference speed (e.g., from 40 tokens/s down to 33 tokens/s with Vulkan).

### 4. Linux Performance (Debian Trixie)

* **OS:** Debian Linux with Gnome graphical interface.
* **Performance Mode:** Activate the Gnome High Performance mode.
* **LM Studio Settings:**
    * **Hardware / Memory Limit:** Set to **110**.
    * **Runtime:** Use `GGUF: Vulkan llama.cpp (Linux) v1.50.2` (ROCm was unstable/unsupported in this configuration).
* **Result:** Achieved **47 tokens/second** for the gpt-oss-120b model, making Linux the fastest environment tested.

## 💡 Troubleshooting and Best Practices

* **Gibberish/Crashes:** If the model outputs gibberish (e.g., "GGGGG...") or crashes, the likely cause is the **Evaluation Batch Size** being too high. **Divide the Evaluation Batch Size by 2** until the model is stable.
* **Context Length Limit:** While the system can support very long context lengths (up to 262144), the practical limit for Qwen3 235B is around **27,000 tokens** before the speed plummets to 1 token/second.
* **Model Runtime Switching:** Different models and versions of LM Studio require different runtimes (e.g., Qwen3 235B favored ROCm, while gpt-oss-120b sometimes required Vulkan depending on the `llama.cpp` version). Users must select the working runtime for each model.


This is an excellent comparison between two of the most powerful current-generation mini PCs, both leveraging AMD's "Zen 5" architecture for CPU and XDNA 2 for AI.

Based on the detailed specifications and focusing on **LLM (Large Language Model) performance**—which primarily depends on the GPU (iGPU) and high-bandwidth memory (VRAM capacity and speed)—the **GMKtec EVO-X2** is clearly the more optimized and powerful machine.

## 🥇 Conclusion: Optimized and More Powerful

The **GMKtec EVO-X2** is unequivocally the **more powerful and optimized** machine for running large LLMs and demanding AI workloads.

### Why the EVO-X2 is Superior for LLMs:

1.  **Massive VRAM Capacity and Bandwidth (The Decisive Factor):**
    * The EVO-X2's use of the high-end "Strix Halo" APU allows for a monumental **40 CUs** and, most importantly, **up to 96GB VRAM allocation** from the 128GB **Eight-Channel LPDDR5X-8000** system memory.
    * This combination of **high CU count**, **massive VRAM pool**, and **eight-channel memory bandwidth** is the "secret sauce" that allows the EVO-X2 to comfortably load and run colossal models like **Qwen3 235B** and **Deepseek 70B** at usable speeds, as demonstrated in your initial data. The memory bandwidth from eight channels is significantly higher than the A9 Max's dual-channel setup.

2.  **Raw GPU Compute:**
    * The EVO-X2's **Radeon 8060S (40 CUs)** is **2.5 times larger** than the A9 Max's Radeon 890M (16 CUs). GPU Compute Units are the primary resource for LLM inference speed (tokens/second), making the EVO-X2 drastically faster for models that fit in VRAM.

3.  **Overall AI Performance (TOPS):**
    * The EVO-X2 boasts an overall AI performance rating of **up to 126 TOPS**, significantly higher than the A9 Max's 80 TOPS total.

While the GEEKOM A9 Max is a top-tier mini PC from the "Strix Point" family, its memory is typically standard dual-channel SODIMM (even if you upgrade to 128GB) and its iGPU is much smaller. For the specific use case of running very large, modern local LLMs, the **GMKtec EVO-X2's "Strix Halo" architecture, with its Quad-Channel/Eight-Channel LPDDR5X and 40CU iGPU, is a class above.**

The GMKtec EVO-X2 can fine-tune LLMs, but it is better suited for *inference* and *multi-node clustering* for extreme loads than for deep training.**

Here is a breakdown of its capabilities regarding tuning and training:

---

## 🛠️ Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)

The GMKtec EVO-X2 is highly capable of running fine-tuning tasks, especially using modern parameter-efficient techniques like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** or **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)**.

* **Key Advantage: 96GB Unified VRAM:** The ability to allocate up to **96GB of high-speed LPDDR5X-8000 memory** as VRAM is the primary factor.
    * Fine-tuning requires loading the base model weights, the optimizer states, and the LoRA adapters into memory simultaneously. 96GB allows you to fine-tune very large models (e.g., 70B parameters) using QLoRA, where a standard dedicated GPU with 24GB or less VRAM would fail.
* **Software:** While tools like LM Studio are currently optimized for **inference**, popular fine-tuning frameworks like **Hugging Face's PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) and **Unsloth** are compatible with AMD's ROCm ecosystem, which allows them to leverage the EVO-X2's powerful integrated GPU.
* **Trade-off:** While the EVO-X2 can handle the *size* of the model, the training *speed* (measured in steps per second) will be significantly slower compared to high-end dedicated GPUs (like an NVIDIA RTX 4090) due to the iGPU's overall lower computational raw power and memory bandwidth compared to a dedicated card's GDDR6X memory.

## ⚙️ Full Training (From Scratch)

**Full training of foundational LLMs from scratch is generally not practical on the EVO-X2.**

* **Resource Requirements:** Training a new foundation model (e.g., a new 7B or 13B LLM) requires massive datasets, hundreds or thousands of gigabytes of VRAM, and weeks or months of computational time, typically done on large clusters of data center GPUs (like NVIDIA H100s or AMD Instincts).
* **Conclusion:** The EVO-X2 is designed for **client-side AI inferencing** and model deployment, not foundational research training.

## 🔗 The EVO-X2's Unique Scaling Solution: Multi-Node Clustering

GMKtec has explicitly addressed the desire for more power by offering a unique solution that leverages the high-speed **USB4 (40Gbps)** ports for massive inference:

* **AI Server Cluster:** The EVO-X2 (128GB version) is designed to support **multi-node clustering** (combining multiple Mini PCs).
* **Configuration:** You can link a **Primary Machine** with one or two **Secondary Machines** using the USB4 Type-C interfaces.
* **Result:** This allows the collective memory pools and compute resources to be used for a single task. This was successfully tested to run the **Qwen3 235B (Q4KM quantization)** model, which required a total memory capacity of **137GB**, demonstrating that the EVO-X2 can be scaled for extremely large LLM deployment.

### Summary for Tuning and Training

| Task | Capability on EVO-X2 | Recommended Alternative Hardware |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inference (Running LLMs)** | **Excellent.** Up to 235B parameters (with clustering). | None better in the Mini PC form factor. |
| **Fine-Tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)** | **Good.** Capable of fine-tuning large models (70B+) using QLoRA due to large VRAM pool, but slower than high-end desktop GPUs. | Dedicated RTX 4080/4090 or AMD Instinct for much faster iterations. |
| **Full Training (From Scratch)** | **Impractical.** Not designed for this workload. | Cloud services (AWS, Azure) or specialized data center hardware. |

**In short, you can definitely use the EVO-X2 for personal LLM fine-tuning projects due to its massive memory, but its true strength lies in its ability to run large models that others simply cannot due to VRAM limitations.**
